# JMDE

Joint Model-based Distance Embedding (JMDE) method developed in the paper:

Zhang, Y., & Ouyang, Z. (2024). Joint model-based distance embedding of multi-track Hi-C data for chromosomal conformation learning. Statistics and Its Interface, 17(3), 565-571.

JMDE covers MDE developed in the paper below as a special case:  

Zhang, Y., Mao, D. and Ouyang, Z. (2022) Model-based distance embedding with applications to chromosomal conformation biology. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 16(3), pp.1253-1267.

JMDE.m function contains an additional input argument comparing to MDE.m function to address the number of input contact matrices.
